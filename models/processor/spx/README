Core design description:
	spx_core_t:
		"spx_core_t", a subclass of "manifold::kernel::Component", 
		includes a "pipeline_t" that is a base class of two different 
		pipeline models; "outorder_t" and "inorder_t". The constructor 
		reads and parses a configuration file using libconfig library, 
		and registers Qsim library callback functions defined in 
		pipeline_t. It does simple fastfwd in unit of Qsim instructions.

	pipeline_t:
		"pipeline_t" is a base class of two pipeline models; "outorder_t"
		and "inorder_t". It defines Qsim library callback functions;
		"Qsim_inst_cb", "Qsim_mem_cb", "Qsim_reg_cb". These callback functions
		must appear in a correct sequence, otherwise "pipeline_t" breaks an
		instruction returned from Qsim library into multiple instructions,
		which is analogous to converting x86 macro-ops to micro-ops. The
		callback sequence follows the order of "enum SPX_QSIM_CB_TYPES."
		"Qsim_post_cb" is used to further break an instruction even after
		Qsim library callbacks were called in a right sequence. For instance,
		an instruction with memory operand and destination register is splitted
		into two separate instructions for certain opcodes. When splitting an
		instruction, pointers to head and next instructions is set to maintain
		Mop-level instruction information after instructions are splitted.

	inst_t:
		"inst_t" is an instruction definition used in "spx_core_t."

	component:
		There are 8 component types used in "spx_core_t." "instQ_t" is a frontend
		buffer where fetched instructions are first queued. "ROB_t" and "RS_t"
		represent reorder buffer and reservation station used in "outorder_t"
		model. "RF_t" is technically a register alias table to keep track of
		instruction dependency. "FU_t" is a unit ALU model, and "EX_t" is a
		set of ALUs for the same type. For instance, if an integer ALU has two
		possible execution ports, then EX_t[SPX_FU_INT] is comprised of two
		FU_t's indexed with port number. STQ_t and LDQ_t are store and load queues,
		respectively. They only maintain entry occupancy but do not really have
		entries for the instructions.

	pipeline/outorder:
		This is an out-order core model that includes all component types defined
		component.h

	pipeline/inorder:
		This is an in-order core model and includes only "instQ_t","RF_t", and 
		"EX_t." "RS_t" is defined only as 1-entry queue to mimic instruction queue 
		of in-order processors.

Examples:
	Creating a spx_core:
		node_cids[i].proc_cid = Component::Create<spx::spx_core_t>(node_lp, 
		node_id, qsim_osd, config_file_path, core_id);

	Connecting spx_core and cache:
		// proc to cache
		Manifold::Connect(node_cids[i].proc_cid, spx_core_t::OUT_TO_DATA_CACHE,
		node_cids[i].cache_cid, MESI_L1_cache::PORT_PROC,
		&MESI_L1_cache::handle_processor_request<spx::cache_request_t>, 1);

		// cache to proc
		Manifold :: Connect(node_cids[i].cache_cid, MESI_L1_cache::PORT_PROC,
		node_cids[i].proc_cid, spx_core_t::IN_FROM_DATA_CACHE,
		&spx_core_t::handle_cache_response, 1);
